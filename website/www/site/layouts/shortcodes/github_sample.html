    There is a reason why the code below is written in 1 line.
    When we nest a shortcode in another shortcode (in our case, we nest github_sample in highlight),
    hugo interprets each line of nested shortcode as a new line character.
    So, if this piece of code consisted of 10 lines, we'd get a highlighted block of code which would
    start with 10 empty lines.
    Trimming this result in parent shortcode solves the problem only partially - we can trim new lines
    at the start and the end of a string. However that wouldn't work if we put TWO or more github_sample
    shortcodes in a highlight - the new line characters would appear in the middle.
    Thus a very ugly, but working solution - writing the whole shortcode in 1 line.
    I wish I found a better solution - if you do, feel free to contribute ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
